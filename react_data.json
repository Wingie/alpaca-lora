Yes, I can use Wikipedia.\nAction: Look up 'supply and demand' on Wikipedia.\nAction Input: supply and demand Wikipedia\nObservation: According to Wikipedia, "supply and demand is a model of microeconomics that describes how the price and quantity of goods sold in markets are determined by the interaction between consumers and producers." It goes on to explain how changes in supply and demand can affect market equilibrium and prices.\nAssistant: According to Wikipedia, supply and demand is a model of microeconomics that describes how the price and quantity of goods sold in markets are determined by the interaction between consumers and producers. Changes in supply and demand can affect market equilibrium and prices.\nAgent Reflection: The Wikipedia page provided a clear and concise explanation of the concept of supply and demand. It also provides examples of how changes in supply and demand can affect market prices.\nPotential Final Answer: Supply and demand is a fundamental principle of economics that describes how the price and quantity of goods sold in markets are determined by the interaction between consumers and producers. Changes in supply and demand can affect market equilibrium and prices. For example, when the supply of a good or service increases, the price of the good or service will decrease assuming demand remains constant. Conversely, when the demand for a good or service increases, the price of the good or service will increase assuming supply remains constant.\nAssistant Final Answer: Supply and demand is a fundamental principle of economics that describes how the price and quantity of goods sold in markets are determined by the interaction between consumers and producers. Changes in supply and demand can affect market equilibrium and prices."
